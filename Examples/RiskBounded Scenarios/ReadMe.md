1. Run Risk_Contours.m to generate the risk contours of the probabilistic safety constraints.

2. Add the risk safety constraints to Example_Risk_SOS_.m

3. Example_Risk_SOS_Yalmip.m uses Yalmip and Example_Risk_SOS_spotless.m uses spotless to verify the safety of the given trajectory based on the SOS formulation.
